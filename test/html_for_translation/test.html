        <p data-lang="Introduction">
            Here is an Emglish text, which should be translated by this library with Deepl. 
        </p>
    
        <p data-lang="Summary">
            In this paragraph, we test, whether the translation also works without being
            interrupted by <strong>tags</strong>. 
            <br><br/>It should also work with the tag, which can exclude content from being 
            translated. This tag is by default labelled "lang-ignore", but can be changed       
            in the settings (settings.js). So, if that ignore-tag works, then there shouldn't be a translation
            of the word "E-N-V-I-R-O-N-M-E-N-T" after the exclamation mark! <lang-ignore>ENVIRONMENT</lang-ignore>
